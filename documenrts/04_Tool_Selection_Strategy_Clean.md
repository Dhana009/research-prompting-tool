Quick Decision Reference:
When you need to quickly decide which tool to use:
1. Search Qdrant with: "tool selection" or "which tool" or "cost optimization"
2. The clean version (2.0_cleaned) will be returned first
3. Check the "Decision Framework" section for quick answers
4. Use the "Cost Comparison Summary" table for credit costs

Note: Old duplicate versions are marked as deprecated - always use the active version (2.0_cleaned).

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Prompt Quality > Model Selection. With proper prompting, GPT-5 Mini (~6.54 credits) can match Claude Sonnet quality (~63.48 credits) for well-known topics. Use premium models intelligently for truly complex novel problems.

AVAILABLE TOOLS & CREDIT COSTS:

BUDGET TIER (Simple Questions):
- Budget GPT-4o-mini: Simple definitions, basic explanations
- Budget GPT-5-nano: Ultra-cheap summarization
- Budget Meta Llama: Extreme budget fallback

STANDARD TIER (Primary Choice):
- GPT-5 Mini (mcp_gemini_call_research_primary): ~6.54 credits/call
  Best value: Can match premium quality with proper prompting
  Use for: Well-known topics, standard research, best practices
- Gemini 2.5 Flash (mcp_gemini_call_research_backup): ~6.51 credits/call
  Backup when GPT-5 Mini fails
- GPT-4.1: ~12.98 credits/call
  More capability than GPT-5 Mini, still cheaper than premium

PREMIUM TIER (Use Sparingly):
- Claude Sonnet 3.7 (mcp_gemini_call_claude_sonnet_model): ~63.48 credits/call
  9.7x more expensive than GPT-5 Mini
  Use for: Complex novel problems requiring deep reasoning
- GPT-5 Thinking: ~93.26 credits/call
  14x more expensive than GPT-5 Mini
  Use for: Critical production decisions only
  Note: Has timeout issues

CODE GENERATION:
- Grok Code Fast (mcp_gemini_call_code_write_primary): ~1.59 credits/call
  Use after research for practical code examples

DECISION FRAMEWORK:

STEP 1: Classify Question Type
- Simple → Budget GPT-4o-mini (definitions, basic facts)
- Well-Known Topic → GPT-5 Mini try 2-3 times (TDD, patterns, best practices)
- Complex Novel Problem → GPT-5 Mini once, then evaluate (deep reasoning, novel solutions)

STEP 2: Smart Escalation Path

For Well-Known Topics:
1. GPT-5 Mini with good prompt (6.54 credits)
2. GPT-5 Mini with improved prompt (6.54 credits)
3. GPT-5 Mini with more context (6.54 credits)
4. GPT-4.1 (12.98 credits) - still cheaper than Claude Sonnet
5. Claude Sonnet (63.48 credits) - only if all above fail

For Complex Novel Problems:
1. GPT-5 Mini with detailed prompt (6.54 credits)
2. If response lacks depth/insight → Claude Sonnet (63.48 credits) - Worth it
3. If critical production decision → GPT-5 Thinking (93.26 credits)

WORKFLOW FOR EACH RESEARCH QUESTION:
1. Classify → Simple / Well-Known / Complex Novel
2. Start with appropriate tool → Budget tier / GPT-5 Mini / GPT-5 Mini (once)
3. Evaluate response quality
   - Sufficient? → Store & Continue
   - Insufficient? → Improve prompt and retry (for well-known topics)
   - Lacks depth? → Escalate to premium (for complex problems)
4. Generate code examples → Grok Code Fast (~1.59 credits)
5. Store results → Qdrant with metadata

COST OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST:
- Tried GPT-5 Mini first? (6.54 credits)
- Improved prompt and tried again? (6.54 credits)
- Added context and tried once more? (6.54 credits)
- Only then considered GPT-4.1? (12.98 credits)
- Only as last resort considered Claude Sonnet? (63.48 credits)

Cost Reality: 3 GPT-5 Mini calls (19.62 credits) < 1 Claude Sonnet call (63.48 credits)

EXAMPLES:

Well-Known Topic (Use GPT-5 Mini):
Q: "What are the most critical test-driven development principles that AI coding assistants must follow?"
- Type: Well-known (TDD is extensively documented)
- Tool: GPT-5 Mini (6.54 credits) - try 2-3 times with improved prompts
- Escalate to: GPT-4.1 → Claude Sonnet only if needed

Complex Novel Problem (Consider Premium):
Q: "Design a novel testing strategy for a distributed system combining event-driven architecture, eventual consistency, and real-time analytics, while maintaining test determinism."
- Type: Complex novel (requires deep reasoning, creative synthesis)
- Tool: Try GPT-5 Mini once (6.54 credits)
- If lacks depth: Claude Sonnet (63.48 credits) - Worth it

KEY RULES:
1. Always start with GPT-5 Mini for research questions (6.54 credits)
2. Invest in prompt quality - better prompt + GPT-5 Mini > average prompt + Claude Sonnet
3. Try GPT-5 Mini 2-3 times with improved prompts before escalating
4. Use premium models intelligently - only for complex novel problems that need deep reasoning
5. Use budget tier for simple definitions/facts
6. Always generate code examples after research (Grok Code Fast, 1.59 credits)
7. Track credit usage and adjust strategy based on actual costs

CODE WRITE PRIMARY TEMPLATES:

Template 1: Pattern Implementation
"Based on the [principle/pattern] from the research, implement a [specific function/class] in [language] that demonstrates [specific behavior]. Include test cases that cover: [Edge case 1 from research], [Edge case 2 from research], [Pattern/principle from research]"

Template 2: Real-World Application
"Using the [TDD principle] discussed in the research, create a [real-world scenario] implementation with comprehensive tests. The tests should demonstrate: [Specific test structure from research], [Specific naming convention from research], [Specific edge case handling from research]"

COST COMPARISON SUMMARY:
- GPT-5 Mini: 6.54 credits/call - Primary choice for most research
- GPT-4.1: 12.98 credits/call - More capability, still cost-effective
- Claude Sonnet: 63.48 credits/call - Complex novel problems only
- GPT-5 Thinking: 93.26 credits/call - Critical production decisions only
- Grok Code Fast: 1.59 credits/call - Code examples after research

Savings Strategy: Try GPT-5 Mini multiple times (19.62 credits for 3 calls) before using Claude Sonnet (63.48 credits for 1 call). Potential savings: ~43.86 credits per question.
